(*
 * The idea of Proc is to abstract away UNIX processes into something
 * more manageable from Ocaml.  To this end, we create abstract Proc.t
 * objects that we store in a weak table; a SIGCHLD handler collects the
 * exit status of child processes and stores them in the Proc.t objects
 * in this table, when possible.
 *
 * A call to Proc.wait then looks in the table for exit status (and thus
 * may be called more than once).  If the child process hasn't exited
 * yet, then Proc.wait actually calls UNIX waitpid to get the exit
 * status.
 *
 * It's also possible to construct a Proc.t object from a pid (int) even
 * if the process wasn't created using this library.  In this case, the
 * library detects whether the process is a child or not, and records
 * this fact in the record.  We don't allow waiting on or getting the
 * status of non-child processes, for obvious reasons.  We also take
 * care in Proc.fork that in the new child process, all the procs in the
 * table are marked as non-children, since they are siblings of the new
 * process.
