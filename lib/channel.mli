(** Convenience operators for specifying shell-style dups.
 *
 * This module provides one prefix operator and a surfeit of infix
 * operators.  The prefix operator {!(!%)} reveals the integer value of
 * an abstract UNIX file descriptor.  The infix operators are for
 * specifying dups, as follows:
 *
 * - Each operator dups its right argument onto its left.  This is the
 *   {i reverse} of {!dup2} and corresponds to the syntax of the Bourne
 *   shell.
 * - The [<] or [>] indicates the direction of IO: [<] is for input
 *   channels and [>] for output channels.
 * - Each operator has a prefix sigil that indicates the type of its
 * first argument: {ul
 *  {- [*] is for {!gen_in_channel}s and {!gen_out_channel}s}
 *  {- [%] is for integer file descriptors}
 *  {- [/] is for [in_channel]s and [out_channel]s}
 *  {- Use [(!%)] on {!descr} to get an [int] suitable for the [%]
 *  operations.)}
 * }
 * - Some operators have a suffix sigil that indicates the type
 * of their second arguments: {ul
 *  {- [&] means the second argument is the same type as the first}
 *  {- [*], [%], [/] are as for the first argument}
 * }
 * - Operators that dup from files indicate the mode in which to open
 * the file: {ul
 *  {- [<] opens a file for reading}
 *  {- [>] opens a file for writing, using the mode from {!clobber}}
 *  {- [>!] opens for writing, always clobbering ([`Clobber])}
 *  {- [>?] opens for writing, never clobbering ([`NoClobber])}
 *  {- [>>] opens for appending ([`Append])}
 *  {- [>>!] opens for appending but won't create ([`AppendOnly])}
 * }
 *
 * Some example dups:
 * - [ 2 %>& 1 ] redirects error output onto standard output
 * - [ 0 %< "file" ] redirects input to come from the file
 * - [ 1 %>/ c ], where [c : out_channel], redirects standard output
 *   into the channel
 * - [ c /<* `Close ] closes [c : in_channel]
